# Task: Migration Strategy Development

## Overview
This task involves creating a phased migration plan for transitioning from the current custom orchestration system to using Dagger as the core technology, defining success criteria for each phase, and establishing rollback procedures.

## Objectives
- Create a detailed phased migration plan
- Define success criteria for each migration phase
- Establish rollback procedures for each phase
- Develop a testing strategy for the migration
- Create a communication plan for stakeholders

## Deliverables
1. Phased migration plan document
2. Success criteria document for each phase
3. Rollback procedures document
4. Migration testing strategy
5. Stakeholder communication plan

## Tasks
1. Develop phased migration approach
   - Define migration phases based on component dependencies
   - Determine the sequence of components to migrate
   - Create a timeline for each phase
   - Identify critical path components

2. Define success criteria
   - Establish measurable success criteria for each phase
   - Define acceptance tests for migrated components
   - Create validation procedures for each phase
   - Develop performance benchmarks for comparison

3. Establish rollback procedures
   - Create rollback procedures for each migration phase
   - Identify rollback triggers and decision points
   - Develop data preservation strategies during migration
   - Create rollback testing procedures

4. Develop testing strategy
   - Define testing approach for each migration phase
   - Create test cases for critical functionality
   - Develop integration test plans
   - Establish performance testing methodology

5. Create communication plan
   - Identify stakeholders affected by the migration
   - Develop communication templates for migration events
   - Create a schedule for status updates
   - Establish escalation procedures for migration issues

## Special Considerations
- Consider the impact of migration on ongoing development
- Evaluate the need for parallel operation during migration
- Assess the impact on CI/CD pipelines
- Consider the training needs for developers working with Dagger
