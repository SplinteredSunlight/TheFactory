# Task: Current Architecture Analysis for Dagger Upgrade

## Overview
This task involves documenting the current orchestration components, their responsibilities, dependencies, and data flows to establish a baseline understanding before migrating to Dagger as the core technology.

## Objectives
- Document all current orchestration components in the AI-Orchestration-Platform
- Identify the responsibilities of each component
- Map dependencies between components
- Document data flows in the current system
- Create architecture diagrams that clearly illustrate the current system

## Deliverables
1. Architecture documentation with detailed component descriptions
2. Component responsibility matrix
3. Dependency mapping between components
4. Data flow diagrams
5. Current architecture diagrams (system-level and component-level)

## Tasks
1. Review existing codebase to identify all orchestration components
   - Focus on `src/orchestrator/`, `src/agent_manager/`, and `src/task_manager/` directories
   - Document the purpose and functionality of each component

2. Analyze component responsibilities
   - Create a matrix mapping components to their responsibilities
   - Identify any overlapping responsibilities
   - Note any components that might be directly replaceable by Dagger

3. Map dependencies between components
   - Identify import/export relationships
   - Document API contracts between components
   - Create a dependency graph

4. Document data flows
   - Trace data through the system from input to output
   - Identify data transformation points
   - Document data storage and retrieval mechanisms

5. Create architecture diagrams
   - System-level architecture diagram
   - Component-level diagrams for key subsystems
   - Data flow diagrams

## Special Considerations
- Pay special attention to the current Dagger integration (`src/agent_manager/dagger_adapter.py` and `src/task_manager/dagger_integration.py`)
- Document how the current system handles error recovery and retries
- Note any custom implementations that might be replaced by Dagger's built-in capabilities

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
None - This is the first task in the Dagger upgrade project
