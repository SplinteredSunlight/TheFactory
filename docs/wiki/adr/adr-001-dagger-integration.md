# ADR-001: Adoption of Dagger for Containerized Workflows

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AI-Orchestration-Platform needed a system for executing workflows in containerized environments to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and portability across different execution environments. We needed a solution that would:

1. Allow workflows to be executed in isolated containers
2. Support workflow composition from reusable components
3. Provide caching capabilities for improved performance
4. Offer robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Integrate with our existing task management system
6. Support various container registries

## Decision
We decided to adopt Dagger.io as our containerized workflow execution engine.

## Rationale
Dagger was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Containerized Execution**: Dagger provides native support for executing workflows in containers, which aligns with our requirement for consistent and isolated execution environments.

2. **Composable Workflows**: Dagger's programming model allows for building workflows by composing smaller, reusable components, which matches our architectural approach.

3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Dagger works consistently across different environments (development, CI/CD, production), solving the "works on my machine" problem.

4. **Built-in Caching**: Dagger includes an automatic caching system that improves workflow performance by reusing results from previous executions when inputs haven't changed.

5. **Active Development**: Dagger is actively maintained and developed by the creators of Docker, giving confidence in its longevity and future development.

6. **Language Support**: Dagger offers SDKs for multiple programming languages, allowing us to integrate with our existing Python-based systems.

7. **Observability**: Dagger provides insights into workflow execution through logs, traces, and metrics.

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Workflows are now executed in consistent, containerized environments.
2. Cache mechanisms significantly improve performance for repeated tasks.
3. Developers can test workflows locally before pushing, improving development efficiency.
4. The modular approach encourages reusable components.
5. Error handling is more robust with automatic retries.

### Negative
1. Adds a new dependency to the system that must be maintained.
2. Requires containerization knowledge from developers.
3. Introduces additional complexity in the integration layer.
4. May have performance overhead for simple tasks due to containerization.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Custom Docker-based Solution
We considered building our own Docker-based workflow system.

- **Pros**: Complete control over features, deeper integration with our systems
- **Cons**: Significant development effort, maintenance burden, risk of reinventing the wheel

### 2. Airflow
We evaluated Apache Airflow as a workflow orchestration tool.

- **Pros**: Mature project, large community, rich feature set
- **Cons**: Heavier weight, less focus on containerization, more complex to set up

### 3. Argo Workflows
We looked at Argo Workflows for Kubernetes-native workflow orchestration.

- **Pros**: Kubernetes-native, good for cloud deployment
- **Cons**: Requires Kubernetes, steeper learning curve, may be overkill for our needs

## Related Decisions
- ADR-002: Error Handling Strategy (influenced by Dagger's retry capabilities)
- ADR-003: Caching Implementation (leverages Dagger's built-in caching)

## Notes
- Initial implementation focused on basic workflow execution; advanced features like multi-stage pipelines will be implemented in future iterations.
- We should monitor Dagger's development roadmap to ensure it continues to meet our needs.
- Regular evaluation of performance impact should be conducted as we add more complex workflows.
