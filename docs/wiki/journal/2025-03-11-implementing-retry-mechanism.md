## Activity Summary
Today I implemented a robust retry mechanism for the Dagger adapter to handle transient failures during workflow execution. This enhancement is a key part of the self-healing capability we're building into the system.

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Differentiating Transient vs. Permanent Failures**: It was challenging to categorize errors as transient (should be retried) or permanent (should fail immediately).
   
2. **Implementing Exponential Backoff**: Determining the right parameters for exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming systems during recovery.
   
3. **Testing Failure Scenarios**: Creating realistic test cases that reproduce various types of transient failures was difficult.
   
4. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Ensuring the retry mechanism worked properly with the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.

## Solutions Implemented
1. For differentiating failures, I created a categorization system in the `error_handling.py` module that classifies errors based on their type and context. Connection errors, timeouts, and certain API errors are classified as transient.

2. For exponential backoff, I implemented a configurable `RetryHandler` class with the following parameters:
   ```python
   RetryHandler(
       max_retries=3,
       backoff_factor=0.5,
       jitter=True,
       retry_exceptions=[ConnectionError, TimeoutError, IntegrationError]
   )
   ```

3. For testing, I created a mock server that can simulate different failure scenarios, including:
   - Random connection drops
   - Timeout responses
   - Rate limiting errors
   - Temporary resource unavailability

4. For circuit breaker integration, I modified the retry logic to respect the circuit breaker state and implemented proper feedback mechanisms between the two systems.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Error Classification is Key**: The most critical aspect of a retry system is correctly identifying which errors should be retried.

2. **Configurability Matters**: Different workflows have different requirements for retry behavior, so making the retry parameters configurable is essential.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**: It's important to test not just the "happy path" but also edge cases like partial failures and recovery scenarios.

4. **Observability**: Adding detailed logging around retries helps with debugging and understanding system behavior.

## Next Steps
1. Add telemetry to track retry frequency and success rates
2. Implement adaptive retry parameters based on historical success rates
3. Create a dashboard visualization for retry events
4. Document best practices for configuring retry parameters for different types of workflows
