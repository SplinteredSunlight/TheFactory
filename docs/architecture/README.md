# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the AI Orchestration Platform. These documents describe the high-level design, components, and interactions of the platform.

## Overview

The AI Orchestration Platform follows a modular, microservices-based architecture that enables flexibility and scalability. The platform integrates AI-Orchestrator and Fast-Agent frameworks with Dagger for containerized workflow execution.

## Core Components

### Orchestration Engine

The Orchestration Engine is responsible for managing workflows and tasks. It coordinates the execution of tasks across different agents and ensures that dependencies are satisfied.

Key files:
- `src/orchestrator/engine.py`
- `src/orchestrator/task_distribution.py`

### Agent Manager

The Agent Manager is responsible for registering, discovering, and executing AI agents. It provides a unified interface for working with different types of agents, including Fast-Agent and AI-Orchestrator agents.

Key files:
- `src/agent_manager/manager.py`
- `src/agent_manager/adapter.py`

### Task Manager

The Task Manager handles the creation, tracking, and execution of tasks. It provides a hierarchical organization of tasks into projects and phases.

Key files:
- `src/task_manager/manager.py`
- `src/task_manager/task_execution_engine.py`

### API Layer

The API Layer provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the platform. It handles authentication, request validation, and response formatting.

Key files:
- `src/api/main.py`
- `src/api/routes/*.py`

### Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a web-based interface for monitoring and managing the platform. It visualizes the status of tasks, agents, and workflows.

Key files:
- `dashboard/index.html`
- `dashboard/js/dashboard.js`

### Dagger Integration

The Dagger Integration enables containerized workflow execution. It provides adapters for creating and executing Dagger workflows.

Key files:
- `src/agent_manager/dagger_adapter.py`
- `src/task_manager/dagger_integration.py`

## Communication Patterns

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate with each other and with the orchestration engine through a standardized messaging protocol. This enables coordination and data sharing between agents.

Key files:
- `src/orchestrator/communication.py`
- `src/orchestrator/dagger_communication.py`

### MCP Server Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration enables the platform to expose functionality through tools that can be used by AI assistants.

Key files:
- `src/task_manager/mcp_servers/task_manager_server.py`
- `src/task_manager/mcp_servers/dagger_workflow_integration.py`

## Deployment Architecture

The platform can be deployed in various configurations, from a single-node development setup to a distributed production environment.

Key files:
- `deployment/dagger-deployment.yaml`
- `deployment/Dockerfile`

## Design Principles

The architecture follows these key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be modular and replaceable
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
3. **Extensibility**: The platform can be extended with new agents and workflows
4. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on load
5. **Resilience**: The platform includes error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Diagrams

Architecture diagrams are available in the following formats:

- Component diagrams showing the high-level structure
- Sequence diagrams showing key interactions
- Deployment diagrams showing runtime configurations
