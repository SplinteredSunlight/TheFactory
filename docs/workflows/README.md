# Workflow Documentation

This directory contains documentation for workflows in the AI Orchestration Platform. Workflows are sequences of tasks that are executed to achieve a specific goal.

## Workflow Concepts

### Workflow Definition

A workflow is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. Each task in the workflow has:

- A name and description
- Input parameters
- Output parameters
- Dependencies on other tasks
- An agent that executes the task

Workflows are typically defined in YAML format:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow
description: An example workflow
version: 1.0.0
inputs:
  input_data:
    type: string
    description: Input data for the workflow
steps:
  - name: step1
    description: First step
    agent: agent1
    inputs:
      data: ${inputs.input_data}
  - name: step2
    description: Second step
    agent: agent2
    inputs:
      data: ${step1.outputs.result}
    depends_on:
      - step1
outputs:
  result:
    description: Workflow result
    value: ${step2.outputs.result}
```

### Workflow Execution

Workflow execution involves:

1. Validating the workflow definition
2. Resolving input parameters
3. Determining the execution order based on dependencies
4. Executing each task in the correct order
5. Handling errors and retries
6. Collecting and returning outputs

## Workflow Types

### Basic Workflows

Basic workflows are simple sequences of tasks with minimal dependencies. They are suitable for straightforward processes.

Documentation:
- [Basic Workflow Guide](basic-workflow.md)
- [Basic Workflow Examples](basic-workflow-examples.md)

### Data Processing Workflows

Data processing workflows focus on transforming, analyzing, and processing data. They typically involve steps for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

Documentation:
- [Data Processing Workflow Guide](data-processing-workflow.md)
- [Data Processing Workflow Examples](data-processing-workflow-examples.md)

### AI Agent Workflows

AI agent workflows coordinate multiple AI agents to solve complex problems. They enable agents to collaborate and share information.

Documentation:
- [AI Agent Workflow Guide](ai-agent-workflow.md)
- [AI Agent Workflow Examples](ai-agent-workflow-examples.md)

### CI/CD Workflows

CI/CD workflows automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. They integrate with version control systems and deployment platforms.

Documentation:
- [CI/CD Workflow Guide](ci-cd-workflow.md)
- [CI/CD Workflow Examples](ci-cd-workflow-examples.md)

## Workflow Features

### Parameter Substitution

Workflows support parameter substitution to pass data between tasks. Parameters can be referenced using the `${...}` syntax.

Documentation:
- [Parameter Substitution Guide](parameter-substitution.md)
- [Parameter Substitution Examples](parameter-substitution-examples.md)

### Conditional Execution

Workflows can include conditional logic to execute different tasks based on conditions. This enables branching and decision-making within workflows.

Documentation:
- [Conditional Execution Guide](conditional-execution.md)
- [Conditional Execution Examples](conditional-execution-examples.md)

### Error Handling

Workflows include error handling mechanisms to detect and recover from failures. This includes retry logic, fallback tasks, and error reporting.

Documentation:
- [Error Handling Guide](error-handling.md)
- [Error Handling Examples](error-handling-examples.md)

### Parallel Execution

Workflows can execute tasks in parallel to improve performance. Tasks without dependencies on each other can run simultaneously.

Documentation:
- [Parallel Execution Guide](parallel-execution.md)
- [Parallel Execution Examples](parallel-execution-examples.md)

## Workflow Templates

Workflow templates provide reusable patterns for common workflow types. They can be customized with parameters to create specific workflow instances.

Documentation:
- [Workflow Template Guide](workflow-template.md)
- [Available Templates](available-templates.md)
- [Creating Custom Templates](creating-custom-templates.md)
