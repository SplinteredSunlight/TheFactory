# Dagger Gap Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for addressing the functionality gaps identified in the gap analysis between the current AI-Orchestration-Platform and Dagger.

## 1. Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into three phases to ensure a smooth migration to Dagger while maintaining system functionality.

### 1.1 Phase 1: Critical Gaps (Weeks 1-3)

This phase focuses on addressing the critical gaps that must be resolved before migration to Dagger can begin.

| MCP Server Integration | Update DaggerWorkflowIntegration for new Dagger client | 5 days | Circuit Breaker Pattern |
| Task Manager Integration | Enhance TaskWorkflowIntegration for Dagger pipelines | 4 days | Circuit Breaker Pattern |
| Agent Communication | Implement custom agent communication system | 5 days | None |

**Deliverables:**
- Circuit breaker component with unit tests
- Updated MCP server integration with Dagger
- Enhanced task manager integration with Dagger
- Agent communication system compatible with Dagger

### 1.2 Phase 2: High Priority Gaps (Weeks 4-6)

This phase addresses high-priority gaps that should be included in the initial release.

| Gap | Implementation Task | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Advanced Error Classification | Implement custom error classification system | 3 days | Circuit Breaker Pattern |

- Agent discovery and capabilities registry

### 1.3 Phase 3: Medium and Low Priority Gaps (Weeks 7-9)

This phase addresses medium and low-priority gaps that can be implemented after the initial release.

| Gap | Implementation Task | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|--------------|

## 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 4.1 Implementation Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Dagger API changes | High | Medium | Monitor Dagger releases, implement adapter pattern for isolation |
| Integration complexity | Medium | High | Incremental approach, thorough testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance degradation | High | Low | Performance testing, optimization, caching strategies |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security review, penetration testing, secure coding practices |
| Backward compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Compatibility layer, feature flags, gradual rollout |

### 4.2 Contingency Plans

1. **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain the ability to revert to the previous implementation if critical issues are encountered
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Allow both old and new implementations to run in parallel during migration
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable Dagger integration components
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect issues early
