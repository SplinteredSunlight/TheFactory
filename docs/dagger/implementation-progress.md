## 2. Current Status

We have completed the planning and analysis phase of the Dagger migration and have made significant progress in the implementation phase. All critical gaps identified in the gap analysis have been addressed:

- ✅ Circuit Breaker Pattern - Implemented a Dagger-specific circuit breaker that extends the base circuit breaker with enhanced features
- ✅ Agent Communication - Implemented Dagger-specific communication manager that extends the base communication manager with enhanced features
- ✅ MCP Server Integration - Implemented DaggerWorkflowIntegration with resource and tool handlers for container management
- ✅ Task Manager Integration - Implemented enhanced TaskWorkflowIntegration with container management, pipeline conversion, status tracking, and result handling

We have also completed all medium-term goals:

- ✅ Advanced Error Classification - Implemented enhanced error classification for Dagger operations
- ✅ Task Management System Core - Implemented the core functionality of the new Dagger-based Task Management System
- ✅ Task Data Model - Designed and implemented the task data model for the new system
- ✅ Task Execution Engine - Implemented the task execution engine with support for Dagger workflows

Additionally, we have completed all the long-term goals related to monitoring, progress tracking, and security:

- ✅ Advanced Monitoring - Implemented comprehensive monitoring with Grafana dashboards, alerting, and a monitoring API
- ✅ Progress Tracking - Implemented real-time progress tracking with WebSockets and progress estimation
- ✅ Security and Authentication - Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) and authentication mechanisms

The "Critical Gaps Implementation" and "Medium-term Goals" tasks have been marked as completed in the task tracking system, and we are now focusing on finalizing the Task Management System and migrating from legacy components.

## 4. Implementation Approach

We will follow an incremental approach to implementation based on dependencies:

1. Start with components that have no dependencies (Circuit Breaker, Agent Communication)
2. Implement components with dependencies once prerequisites are complete (MCP Server and Task Manager Integration depend on Circuit Breaker)
3. Use feature flags to control rollout of new functionality
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
5. Implement comprehensive testing at each stage
6. Document all components and provide usage examples

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

Key risks for the implementation phase include:

1. **Dagger API Changes**: Monitor Dagger releases, implement adapter pattern
2. **Integration Complexity**: Use incremental approach, thorough testing
3. **Performance Issues**: Conduct performance testing, optimize as needed
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility layer during transition

## 6. Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All critical and high-priority gaps are addressed
2. System functionality is maintained or improved
3. Performance meets or exceeds current levels
4. New task management system is operational
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

This document will be updated regularly to reflect progress and any changes to the implementation plan.
