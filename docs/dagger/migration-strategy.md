# Dagger Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the AI-Orchestration-Platform to Dagger. It provides a phased approach with clear success criteria and rollback procedures to ensure a smooth transition.

![Migration Strategy Overview](../images/dagger-migration-strategy.md)

## 1. Migration Principles

The migration to Dagger will be guided by the following principles:

1. **Incremental Approach**: Migrate components incrementally to minimize risk and allow for continuous operation.
2. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing functionality is maintained or improved during migration.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing systems during the transition.
4. **Validation at Each Step**: Define clear success criteria for each migration phase.
5. **Rollback Capability**: Implement rollback procedures for each phase in case of issues.
6. **Minimal Downtime**: Design the migration to minimize service disruptions.
7. **Performance Preservation**: Ensure performance is maintained or improved after migration.

## 2. Migration Phases

The migration is divided into four phases, each with specific goals, success criteria, and rollback procedures.

### 2.1 Phase 1: Foundation and Critical Components (Weeks 1-4)

This phase focuses on establishing the foundation for Dagger integration and migrating critical components.

#### Goals:
- Implement critical gap solutions (Circuit Breaker, MCP Server Integration, Task Manager Integration, Agent Communication)
- Set up Dagger infrastructure and configuration
- Migrate non-user-facing components first
- Establish monitoring and observability for Dagger components

#### Components to Migrate:
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Dagger client configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Monitoring and logging infrastructure

2. **Core Components**
   - Circuit Breaker implementation (already completed)
   - Basic error handling integration
   - Core Dagger client wrapper

3. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Update DaggerWorkflowIntegration for new Dagger client
   - Implement MCP resources for Dagger workflows
   - Create MCP tools for Dagger operations

4. **Task Manager Integration**
   - Enhance TaskWorkflowIntegration for Dagger pipelines
   - Implement adapters for task-to-pipeline conversion

#### Success Criteria:

#### Rollback Procedure:
1. Reactivate legacy system components (if still available)
2. Revert to Phase 3 configuration
3. Notify users of rollback and any necessary actions
4. Verify system functionality with automated tests
5. Develop new migration plan addressing issues encountered

## 3. Feature Flag Strategy

Feature flags will be used to control the rollout of Dagger components and enable quick rollbacks if needed.

### 3.1 Flag Categories

1. **Component Flags**: Control which components use Dagger vs. legacy implementation
   - `USE_DAGGER_WORKFLOW_ENGINE`
   - `USE_DAGGER_TASK_MANAGER`
   - `USE_DAGGER_MCP_SERVER`

2. **Feature Flags**: Control specific features within components
   - `ENABLE_DAGGER_CACHING`
   - `ENABLE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER`
   - `ENABLE_ADVANCED_MONITORING`

3. **User Flags**: Control which users see Dagger features
   - `SHOW_DAGGER_UI_TO_ADMINS`
   - `SHOW_DAGGER_UI_TO_ALL_USERS`

### 3.2 Flag Management

- Flags will be managed through a central configuration system
- Changes to flags will be logged and audited
- Flag states will be included in monitoring and alerts
- Regular cleanup of unused flags after migration phases

See [Feature Flag Configuration Example](feature-flag-config-example.json) for a detailed example of how feature flags will be configured and managed throughout the migration process.

## 4. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be employed to ensure the success of the migration.

### 4.1 Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **System Tests**: Test end-to-end functionality
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance meets or exceeds requirements
5. **Chaos Tests**: Verify system resilience under failure conditions
6. **User Acceptance Tests**: Verify user-facing functionality

### 4.2 Testing Schedule

- **Pre-Migration**: Establish baseline tests and performance benchmarks
- **During Each Phase**: Run tests for migrated components and integration tests
- **Phase Completion**: Run full system tests and performance benchmarks
- **Post-Migration**: Run comprehensive test suite and long-term stability tests

## 5. Monitoring and Observability

Enhanced monitoring will be implemented to track the health and performance of the system during and after migration.

## 7. Rollback Decision Criteria

Clear criteria will be established for when to trigger a rollback during the migration.

### 7.1 Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Critical functionality failure
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation beyond threshold (e.g., >50% slower)
- Error rate increase beyond threshold (e.g., >10% increase)

### 7.2 Manual Rollback Considerations

- User experience issues
- Functionality gaps
- Integration problems with external systems
- Resource utilization concerns
- Timeline delays

See [Rollback Script Example](rollback-script-example.sh) for a detailed example of how rollbacks will be implemented during the migration process.

## 8. Success Metrics

Overall success of the migration will be measured using the following metrics:

1. **Functionality**: All existing functionality is maintained or improved
2. **Performance**: System performance meets or exceeds pre-migration levels
3. **Reliability**: System reliability meets or exceeds pre-migration levels
4. **User Satisfaction**: User feedback is positive
5. **Development Efficiency**: Developer productivity is improved
6. **Operational Efficiency**: Operational costs and effort are reduced

## 9. Post-Migration Activities

After completing the migration, the following activities will be conducted:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
2. **Documentation Finalization**: Complete all documentation updates
3. **Training**: Conduct training sessions for users, administrators, and developers
