# Task Manager Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the legacy task management system to the new Dagger-based Task Management System.

## Overview

The migration process involves the following steps:

1. **Preparation**: Validate legacy data and create backups
2. **Migration**: Migrate projects, phases, tasks, and workflows to the new system
3. **Verification**: Verify data integrity, functionality, and performance
4. **Optimization**: Optimize performance of the new system
5. **Decommissioning**: Archive legacy data and decommission the legacy system

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Dagger is installed and configured
- The new Task Management System is deployed and operational
- All required dependencies are installed
- Sufficient disk space is available for backups and archives

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Preparation

1. Validate legacy data to ensure it can be migrated
2. Create a backup of the legacy data
3. Configure the migration settings

### Step 2: Migration

1. Migrate projects from the legacy system to the new system
2. Migrate phases from the legacy system to the new system
3. Migrate tasks from the legacy system to the new system
4. Create workflows for tasks in the new system

### Step 3: Verification

1. Verify data integrity between legacy and new systems
2. Verify functionality of the new system
3. Verify performance of the new system

### Step 4: Optimization

1. Optimize database queries
2. Optimize workflow execution
3. Optimize caching

### Step 5: Decommissioning

1. Archive legacy data
2. Decommission legacy system
3. Update documentation and user guides

## Migration Scripts

The following scripts are provided to automate the migration process:

- `run_migration.sh`: Main script to run the entire migration process
- `execute_migration.py`: Script to execute the migration
- `test_migration.py`: Script to test the migration
- `optimize_performance.py`: Script to optimize performance
- `decommission_legacy.py`: Script to decommission the legacy system
- `rollback_migration.py`: Script to rollback the migration if needed

## Usage

To run the migration, use the following command:

```bash
./scripts/task_manager/run_migration.sh
```

To run a dry run without making any changes:

```bash
./scripts/task_manager/run_migration.sh --dry-run
```

To run specific phases of the migration:

```bash
./scripts/task_manager/run_migration.sh --phase prepare,migrate,verify
```

To specify custom paths:

```bash
./scripts/task_manager/run_migration.sh \
  --legacy-data /path/to/legacy/data \
  --new-data /path/to/new/data \
  --backup /path/to/backup \
  --id-mapping /path/to/id_mapping.json \
  --dagger-config /path/to/dagger.yaml \
  --templates-dir /path/to/templates \
  --verification-report /path/to/verification_report.json \
  --archive /path/to/archive
```

## Rollback

If the migration fails or needs to be rolled back, use the following command:

```bash
./scripts/task_manager/rollback_migration.sh
```

This will restore the legacy system from the backup and clean up any data created in the new system.

## Monitoring

The migration process can be monitored using the following:

- Log files: `migration_execution.log`, `task_migration.log`, `migration_test.log`
- Statistics file: `migration_execution_stats.json`
- Verification report: `verification_report.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Legacy data validation fails**
   - Check the legacy data for inconsistencies
   - Fix any issues in the legacy data and try again

2. **Migration fails**
   - Check the log files for errors
   - Fix any issues and try again

3. **Verification fails**
   - Check the verification report for details
   - Fix any issues and try again

4. **Performance issues**
   - Run the optimization script
   - Check the database configuration
   - Check the Dagger configuration

## Post-Migration Tasks

After the migration is complete, perform the following tasks:

1. Update user documentation
2. Train users on the new system
3. Monitor the new system for issues
4. Gather feedback from users
5. Make improvements based on feedback

## Timeline

The migration process is expected to take the following time:

- Preparation: 1 hour
- Migration: 2-4 hours (depending on the amount of data)
- Verification: 1-2 hours
- Optimization: 1-2 hours
- Decommissioning: 1 hour

Total: 6-10 hours
