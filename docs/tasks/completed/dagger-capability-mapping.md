# Task: Dagger Capability Mapping

## Overview
This task involves creating a comprehensive mapping of current AI-Orchestration-Platform features to Dagger capabilities, identifying which parts can be directly replaced by Dagger and documenting Dagger limitations that will require custom solutions.

## Objectives
- Create a detailed mapping between current features and Dagger capabilities
- Identify components that can be directly replaced by Dagger
- Document Dagger limitations that will require custom solutions
- Evaluate the effort required for each replacement

## Deliverables
1. Capability mapping document with feature comparison matrix
2. Direct replacement opportunities list
3. Dagger limitations assessment
4. Effort estimation for each replacement

## Tasks
1. Research and document Dagger capabilities
   - Review Dagger documentation and examples
   - Explore Dagger Cloud features
   - Document Dagger's built-in capabilities for workflow orchestration, caching, and monitoring

2. Create a feature comparison matrix
   - List all current AI-Orchestration-Platform features
   - Map each feature to corresponding Dagger capabilities
   - Identify feature gaps and overlaps
   - Rate compatibility (direct replacement, partial replacement, custom solution needed)

3. Identify direct replacement opportunities
   - List components that can be directly replaced by Dagger
   - Document the Dagger features that will replace them
   - Estimate effort required for each replacement

4. Document Dagger limitations
   - Identify features not supported by Dagger
   - Assess impact of these limitations
   - Propose mitigation strategies for each limitation

5. Evaluate integration points
   - Identify how Dagger will integrate with remaining custom components
   - Document API requirements for integration
   - Assess potential performance impacts

## Special Considerations
- Consider both open-source Dagger and Dagger Cloud capabilities
- Evaluate the impact of the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable in CI
- Pay special attention to Dagger's AI agent integration capabilities
- Consider how Dagger's caching mechanisms compare to current implementations

## Estimated Effort
