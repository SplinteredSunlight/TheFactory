# Task: Dagger Critical Gaps Implementation - Phase 1

## Overview
This task involves implementing the critical gaps identified in Phase 1 of the Dagger Gap Analysis. These are the highest priority gaps that must be addressed before migration to Dagger can begin.

## Objectives
- Implement the Circuit Breaker Pattern for Dagger operations
- Update the MCP Server Integration for the new Dagger client
- Enhance the Task Manager Integration for Dagger pipelines
- Implement the Agent Communication system compatible with Dagger

## Deliverables
1. Circuit Breaker component with unit tests
2. Updated MCP server integration with Dagger
3. Enhanced task manager integration with Dagger
4. Agent communication system compatible with Dagger

## Tasks

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation
- Create a `CircuitBreaker` class that tracks failure rates for Dagger operations
- Implement state management (closed, open, half-open) based on failure thresholds
- Integrate with the existing error handling system
- Create a wrapper function for Dagger client operations
- Write comprehensive unit tests for the circuit breaker

### 2. MCP Server Integration
- Update the `DaggerWorkflowIntegration` class to use the new Dagger client
- Implement MCP resources that expose Dagger workflow information
- Create MCP tools for creating and executing Dagger workflows
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing MCP clients
- Write tests for the updated integration

### 3. Task Manager Integration
- Update the `TaskWorkflowIntegration` class to use the new Dagger client
- Implement methods for creating Dagger pipelines from tasks
- Create adapters for translating task information to Dagger pipeline parameters
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing task management system
- Write tests for the enhanced integration

### 4. Agent Communication System
- Create a `CommunicationManager` class that handles agent communication
- Implement methods for sending and receiving messages between agents
- Create adapters for translating messages to Dagger container communication
- Integrate with the existing communication system
- Write tests for the agent communication system

## Special Considerations
- Ensure all implementations follow the design patterns and coding standards of the project
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new components
- Document all new components and their integration with existing systems
- Consider performance implications of the new implementations
