# Task: Dagger Gap Analysis

## Overview
This task involves identifying functionality gaps between the current AI-Orchestration-Platform and Dagger, prioritizing these gaps based on importance to project requirements, and developing strategies for addressing each gap.

## Objectives
- Identify all functionality gaps between current system and Dagger
- Prioritize gaps based on importance to project requirements
- Develop strategies for addressing each gap
- Create a roadmap for implementing gap solutions

## Deliverables
1. Gap analysis document with prioritized list of gaps
2. Impact assessment for each gap
3. Mitigation strategies document
4. Implementation roadmap for gap solutions

## Tasks
1. Analyze functionality gaps
   - Review the capability mapping document
   - Identify features not supported by Dagger
   - Document the impact of each gap on system functionality
   - Categorize gaps by component (orchestration, task management, monitoring, etc.)

2. Prioritize gaps
   - Develop prioritization criteria (impact on functionality, user experience, etc.)
   - Rate each gap based on criteria
   - Create a prioritized list of gaps
   - Identify critical gaps that must be addressed before migration

3. Develop mitigation strategies
   - For each gap, develop potential solutions
   - Consider custom development, third-party integrations, and workarounds
   - Evaluate each solution based on effort, maintainability, and performance
   - Select the optimal solution for each gap

4. Create implementation roadmap
   - Sequence gap solutions based on priority and dependencies
   - Estimate effort for each solution
   - Develop a timeline for implementation
   - Identify integration points with Dagger migration

5. Identify risks and contingencies
   - Identify risks associated with each gap solution
   - Develop contingency plans
   - Document assumptions and constraints
   - Create a risk mitigation plan

## Special Considerations
- Consider the impact of gaps on the project's functional requirements
- Evaluate the long-term maintainability of custom solutions
- Consider the potential for future Dagger updates to address gaps
- Assess the impact of gap solutions on system performance and scalability
