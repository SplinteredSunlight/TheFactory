# Integration Task: Complete Dagger Integration

## Task Description
This task involves completing the integration of Dagger.io into the AI-Orchestration-Platform to leverage its containerized workflow capabilities.

## Integration Context
Dagger is a powerful composable runtime for workflows that can enhance our platform's containerized execution capabilities. Initial scraping is complete but we need to integrate Dagger's API into our orchestration engine.

## Components Involved
- Orchestration Engine: Manages workflow execution and needs to support Dagger workflows
- Integration Layer: Requires adapter for Dagger's API
- Agent Manager: Needs to support Dagger-based agents

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement adapter for Dagger's API in the integration layer
2. Create configuration options for Dagger workflows
3. Add Dagger integration to the orchestration engine
4. Update the agent manager to support Dagger-based agents
5. Create examples of Dagger-orchestrated workflows

## Integration Points
- Dagger API integration with the Orchestration Engine
- Containerized workflow execution in the Integration Layer
- Agent configuration for Dagger-based agents
- Error handling for Dagger operations
- Performance monitoring for Dagger workflows

## Testing Requirements
- Test Dagger workflow execution with various configurations
- Verify containerized execution works correctly
- Test performance of Dagger-based workflows 
- Verify error handling for Dagger operations
- Test integration with existing workflow systems

## Documentation Requirements
- Update architecture documentation with Dagger integration details
- Create guide for developing Dagger-based workflows
- Document configuration options for Dagger integration
- Update API contracts with Dagger-specific endpoints
- Create examples of common Dagger workflow patterns

After completing this task run ./task complete to mark it as completed and get the prompt for the next task.
