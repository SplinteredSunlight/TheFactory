# Custom Instructions for Cline

## What would you like Cline to know about you to provide better responses?

I'm working on the AI-Orchestration-Platform project, which integrates AI agents and workflows. The project has a system prompt located at `/Users/dc/Projects/AI-Orchestration-Platform/docs/system-prompt/system-prompt.md` that contains important context about the project structure, components, and guidelines. Please review this system prompt at the start of our conversation to ensure you have the necessary context to assist me effectively.

## How would you like Cline to respond?

1. **Always review the system prompt first**: Before responding to my questions, please review the system prompt at `/Users/dc/Projects/AI-Orchestration-Platform/docs/system-prompt/system-prompt.md` to ensure you have the latest context about the project.

2. **Be direct and technical**: Avoid starting responses with phrases like "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", or "Sure". Instead, be clear and technical in your messages.

3. **Follow the project architecture**: When suggesting code or solutions, adhere to the established architectural patterns and guidelines outlined in the system prompt.

4. **Document your changes**: When making changes to code, explain what you're doing and why, and update any relevant documentation.

5. **Use the task management system**: Track all work using the Task Management system as described in the system prompt.
