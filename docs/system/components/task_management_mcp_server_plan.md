# Task Management MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines how to implement a standalone Task Management MCP server that integrates with the AI-Orchestration-Platform while also being usable as a standalone tool to manage project completion. The MCP server will expose the task management functionality through the Model Context Protocol, making it accessible to AI agents and other components of the system.

## Goals

1. Create a standalone MCP server that provides task management functionality
2. Integrate with the existing Project Master Dashboard for a unified UI

## Detailed Technical Design

### Task Management MCP Server

The Task Management MCP server will expose the following tools and resources:

#### Tools:
- `create_project`: Create a new project
- `update_project`: Update an existing project
- `delete_project`: Delete a project
- `create_phase`: Create a new phase in a project
- `update_phase`: Update an existing phase
- `delete_phase`: Delete a phase
- `create_task`: Create a new task
- `update_task`: Update an existing task
- `delete_task`: Delete a task
- `assign_task`: Assign a task to an agent or user
- `start_task`: Mark a task as started
- `complete_task`: Mark a task as completed
- `calculate_progress`: Calculate progress for a project or phase

#### Resources:
- `task-manager://projects`: List of all projects
- `task-manager://projects/{project_id}`: Information about a specific project
- `task-manager://projects/{project_id}/phases`: Phases in a project
- `task-manager://projects/{project_id}/tasks`: Tasks in a project
- `task-manager://tasks/{task_id}`: Information about a specific task

### Standalone CLI Tool

The standalone CLI tool will provide the following commands:

- `task-dashboard start`: Start the task management system
- `task-dashboard project list`: List all projects
- `task-dashboard project create`: Create a new project
- `task-dashboard task list`: List tasks in a project
- `task-dashboard task create`: Create a new task
- `task-dashboard task update`: Update a task
- `task-dashboard task complete`: Mark a task as completed

### Project Master Dashboard Integration

The Project Master Dashboard will be updated to connect to the MCP server and provide a unified UI for task management. The main changes include:

1. Update the API module to use MCP tools and resources
2. Add support for WebSocket connections to the MCP server
3. Enhance the UI for better task management
4. Add simplified configuration for standalone mode

### Dagger Integration

The Dagger integration will allow tasks to be executed as containerized workflows. The main features include:

1. Convert tasks to Dagger workflows based on dependencies
2. Update task status based on workflow execution results
3. Create workflow examples demonstrating common use cases

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring compatibility with both standalone mode and integration
   **Mitigation**: Use dependency injection and configuration to support both modes

2. **Challenge**: Real-time updates across distributed components
   **Mitigation**: Implement a reliable WebSocket system with reconnection handling

3. **Challenge**: Efficient task dependency resolution for complex projects
   **Mitigation**: Use a topological sort algorithm for dependency resolution

4. **Challenge**: Handling offline operation for standalone mode
   **Mitigation**: Implement local storage with synchronization when online

## Conclusion

The implementation of a Task Management MCP server will provide a powerful standalone tool for managing project completion while also integrating seamlessly with the AI-Orchestration-Platform. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol, the system will be accessible to AI agents and other components, making it a flexible and extensible solution for task management.
