# Monitoring Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for the monitoring infrastructure of the AI Orchestration Platform.

## Configuration Files

- **alerting_rules.yml**: Rules for generating alerts based on monitoring metrics
- **alertmanager.yml**: Configuration for the Alertmanager service, which handles alert routing and notifications
- **prometheus.yml**: Configuration for the Prometheus monitoring system
- **grafana-dagger-dashboard.json**: Grafana dashboard configuration for Dagger monitoring
- **grafana-dagger-advanced-dashboard.json**: Advanced Grafana dashboard configuration for Dagger monitoring

## Usage

These configuration files are used by the monitoring infrastructure to collect metrics, generate alerts, and visualize the state of the AI Orchestration Platform.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used to collect and store metrics from the AI Orchestration Platform. The `prometheus.yml` file configures:

- Scrape intervals and timeouts
- Target endpoints for metric collection
- Relabeling and filtering rules

### Alertmanager

Alertmanager handles alerts generated by Prometheus. The `alertmanager.yml` file configures:

- Alert routing
- Notification receivers (email, Slack, etc.)
- Grouping and inhibition rules

### Grafana Dashboards

The Grafana dashboard JSON files define visualizations for monitoring data. They can be imported into a Grafana instance to provide:

- Real-time monitoring of system performance
- Visualization of key metrics
- Historical trend analysis
