# Cross-System Configuration UI

The Cross-System Configuration UI is a feature of the AI-Orchestration-Platform that allows users to configure and manage the integration between AI-Orchestrator and Fast-Agent systems.

## Overview

This feature provides a comprehensive interface for:

1. Managing system endpoints for both AI-Orchestrator and Fast-Agent
2. Creating and configuring connections between systems
3. Monitoring the status and performance of integrations
4. Viewing sync history and troubleshooting issues

## Components

### CrossSystemConfiguration

The main component that provides a tabbed interface for managing system configurations:

- **Dashboard Tab**: Provides an overview of all systems and connections
- **Systems Tab**: Allows adding, editing, and deleting system endpoints
- **Connections Tab**: Allows creating, configuring, and managing connections between systems
- **Sync History Tab**: Displays the history of synchronization events

### ConfigurationDashboard

A dashboard component that displays:

- System overview statistics
- System distribution charts
- Active systems and connections
- Performance metrics for connections
- Sync history visualization

### SystemEndpointCard

A card component for displaying and managing individual system endpoints:

- System details (name, URL, authentication type)
- Enable/disable toggle
- Edit and delete options
- Test connection functionality

### ConnectionCard

A card component for displaying and managing connections between systems:

- Connection details (source, target, type, sync interval)
- Enable/disable toggle
- Edit and delete options
- Test connection and sync now functionality

## Usage

The Cross-System Configuration UI is accessible from the Settings page under the "Cross-System" tab. From there, users can:

1. **Add Systems**: Configure endpoints for AI-Orchestrator, Fast-Agent, or external systems
2. **Create Connections**: Set up data flow between systems with customizable sync intervals
3. **Monitor Performance**: View metrics and charts showing system performance and sync history
4. **Troubleshoot Issues**: Test connections and view detailed sync logs

## Integration with Agent Configuration

The Cross-System Configuration UI works with the unified agent configuration schema to ensure consistent representation of agents across both AI-Orchestrator and Fast-Agent frameworks. This integration allows:

- Seamless communication between different agent types
- Consistent configuration interface for all agents
- Centralized management of cross-system interactions

## Technical Details

### State Management

The configuration state is managed through Redux using the `configurationSlice`, which includes:

- Systems: Array of system endpoints
- Connections: Array of connections between systems
- Sync history: Record of synchronization events
- Loading and error states

### API Integration

The UI communicates with backend services through RTK Query endpoints:

- `useGetSystemsQuery`: Fetch all system endpoints
- `useAddSystemMutation`: Add a new system endpoint
- `useUpdateSystemMutation`: Update an existing system
- `useDeleteSystemMutation`: Delete a system
- `useGetConnectionsQuery`: Fetch all connections
- `useAddConnectionMutation`: Add a new connection
- `useUpdateConnectionMutation`: Update an existing connection
- `useDeleteConnectionMutation`: Delete a connection
- `useTestConnectionMutation`: Test a connection
- `useSyncNowMutation`: Trigger immediate synchronization

## Testing

The Cross-System Configuration UI components are tested using React Testing Library and Jest. Tests cover:

- Component rendering
- User interactions (adding/editing systems and connections)
- API integration
- Error handling

## Features

The Cross-System Configuration UI includes the following features:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Provides a comprehensive view of all systems and connections with key metrics and statistics
2. **System Health Monitoring**: Displays health status for all connected systems with visual indicators
3. **Data Flow Visualization**: Shows the flow of data between connected systems with detailed mapping information
4. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and displays response times and sync performance for all connections
5. **Sync History**: Detailed logs of all synchronization events with success/failure status
6. **Filtering Options**: Ability to filter by active/inactive systems and connections
7. **Tabbed Navigation**: Easy navigation between different dashboard views

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for the Cross-System Configuration UI include:

1. Advanced data mapping configuration for connections
2. Real-time sync monitoring with live updates
3. Automated sync scheduling with calendar integration
4. Enhanced visualization of data flow between systems with animated data flow
5. Integration with system-wide alerting and notification system
6. Custom dashboard layouts with drag-and-drop widgets
7. Export and import of configuration settings
