# AI Orchestration Platform: Cleanup and Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- Created archive directory structure for legacy components
- Established standardized directory structure for documentation
- Set up task directories (active, backlog, completed)
- Created test directories (unit, integration, performance)

### 2. Legacy Task Manager Cleanup
- Archived the legacy task manager files to archive/legacy_task_manager/
- Archived the backup task manager to archive/legacy_task_manager/backup/
- Preserved the task manager functionality in archive for reference

### 3. Migration Files Cleanup
- Archived migration log files to archive/migration_files/
- Copied the migration script to archive for reference
- Created placeholders for empty log files to preserve structure

### 4. Task and Roadmap Files Cleanup
- Moved completed tasks to archive/completed_tasks/
- Organized active tasks in tasks/active/
- Created backlog directory for future task planning
- Archived old roadmap files to archive/old_roadmaps/

### 5. Documentation Organization
- Created specialized documentation directories (architecture, user_guides, api, etc.)
- Created documentation index with navigation to all sections
- Created updated project roadmap based on latest requirements

### 6. Project Roadmap Update
- Created new project roadmap with 6 phases spanning 16 weeks
- Added detailed milestones and tasks for each phase
- Updated current status and next steps information

### 7. README Update
- Updated main README with current project structure
- Enhanced architecture description
- Added information about Dagger integration
- Improved setup and development instructions

## Summary of Changes

| Category | Files Changed | New Files Created | Directories Created |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Task Management | 4 | 2 | 4 |
| Documentation | 4 | 3 | 5 |
| Project Structure | 1 | 0 | 10 |
| Migration | 5 | 2 | 1 |
| Total | 14 | 7 | 20 |

## Next Steps

1. **Continue with Phase 1 tasks:**
   - Document the modular component architecture
   - Create visual architecture diagrams
   - Update interface documentation
   - Enhance development environment setup

2. **Begin Phase 2 planning:**
   - Prepare for Dagger integration advancement
   - Design minimal test workflows
   - Plan error handling and resilience improvements

3. **Documentation enhancement:**
   - Start populating architecture documentation
   - Create initial user guides
   - Develop API documentation

The cleanup and reorganization has significantly improved the project structure, making it more maintainable and easier to navigate. The legacy components have been properly archived for reference while the active development can now proceed with a clean structure following best practices.
